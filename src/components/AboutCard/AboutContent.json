    "content": "As one of the premier institutions for technical education in the country, National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli has strived to provide students with the best academic syllabi and even better academic exposure since its establishment in 1964.Pragyan, the international techno-managerial organisation of NIT Trichy, which came into being in 2005, achieves just that by providing a platform for a multitude of students to showcase their technical ingenuity and prowess. With its annual self-titled fest, Pragyan has come a long way since its inception. It basks in the limelight with the London Olympics and Manchester United, the football club, as one of the three organisations to have ever achieved the ISO 20121:2012 Certification for Sustainable Event Management. Pragyan also holds the coveted honour of being the only student-run organisation amongst the three. In addition, Pragyan has the ISO 9001:2015 Certification for Quality Management Systems. Moreover, it has been registered as a case study in The Case Centre, London.",
    "content1": "With 'Chronocle' as its theme, the twentieth edition of Pragyan will be conducted on the NITT campus in all its grandeur. With this edition, we aim to introspect time - what has been, what is, and what will be. The past, the present, and the future is carried by each of us. Pragyan '24 will bring these three together, so that to make the best of all the parallels and celebrate technology.",
    "content2": " In the previous year, Pragyan grew from the hybrid fest of 2022 to a completely offline fest. The theme of Pragyan '23 was Cyberscape and was a surreal experience at that. The edition had many sessions with renowned speakers, scholars, and eminent  personalities on our Pragyan Guest Lectures and Q&A sessions. With events, podcasts, and articles spreading awareness and information, Pragyan is sustaining its zeal."
