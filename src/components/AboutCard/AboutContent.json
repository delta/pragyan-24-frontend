    "content": "In the previous year, Pragyan grew from the hybrid fest of 2022 to a completely offline fest. The theme of Pragyan '23 was Cyberscape and was a surreal experience at that. The edition had many sessions with renowned speakers, scholars, and eminent  personalities on our Pragyan Guest Lectures and Q&A sessions. With events, podcasts, and articles spreading awareness and information, Pragyan is sustaining its zeal. With \"Chronocle\" as its theme, the twentieth edition of Pragyan will be conducted on the NITT campus in all its grandeur. With this edition, we aim to introspect time - what has been, what is, and what will be. The past, the present, and the future is carried by each of us. Pragyan '24 will bring these three together, so that to make the best of all the parallels and celebrate technology."
